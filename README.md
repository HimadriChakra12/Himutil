## Utiliies
"HimUtil" has 3 Utility
1. Activator
2. CTT
3. Package Management

### Activator
Activator runs himact.ps1. It downloads activator cmd according to your windows.

[10] Downloads 10act.cmd and runs it;
[11] Downloads 11act.cmd and runs it

### CTT
CTT aka ChrisTitusTool aka WinUtil has a Tweaks section. Most of the people uses it specially the Standard Option. And some uses the advanced options as well. And some people even removes the MSApps aswell. I use Three of them. so keeping this in mind I place total 4 option for the users.
```
1. CTT Standard Tweaks
2. CTT Advanced Tweaks
3. 1 & 2
4. 3 with MSapps Removal
```
[1] will do the standard tweaks;
[2] will do the advanced;
[3] will do both;
[4] will do them and will remove microsoft apps as well.

### Package management
[1] Choco and Scoop is done.
[2] It partially automated(for LTSC users). Like you have to wait for the "MSStore" Installation, then manually install "winget" with it.
